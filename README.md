# Possible 2024 ML Challenge

## Overview

Data preparation is a very important step in Machine Learning, but it can often be tedious and time-consuming. In fact, 80% of the time spent developing ML pipelines is typically dedicated to data preparation. Teradata simplifies this process with its powerful in-database analytic functions. In this challenge, you'll complete building a data preparation pipeline, but with a twist — we've removed the function names! By solving this challenge, you'll gain hands-on experience with Teradata's ClearScape Analytics and learn how it can make your data preparation tasks easier and more efficient.

## Instructions

To complete this challenge, follow the steps below:

1. **Fork the repository**:
   Begin by forking the following repository to your own GitHub account:
   [https://github.com/Teradata/Possible2024_ML-Challenge.git](https://github.com/Teradata/Possible2024_ML-Challenge.git)

2. **Business scenario and dataset**:
   You are provided with a business scenario, a dataset, and prefilled steps in the Jupyter notebook `customer_churn_machine_learning_challenge.ipynb`.

3. **Complete the pipeline**:
   The notebook is incomplete — your task is to identify the missing elements. Specifically, you'll need to:

   - Identify and import the necessary libraries.
   - Fill in the missing ClearScape Analytics functions for data preparation.
   - Add any additional data preprocessing steps required.

   You'll find hints in the notebook's markdown cells to help you along the way. Refer to the [Teradata documentation](https://docs.teradata.com/r/Enterprise_IntelliFlex_VMware/Database-Analytic-Functions/Introduction-to-Analytics-Database-Analytic-Functions) for guidance on the missing functions and steps.

4. **Access a Free Teradata Environment**:
    You can access a free Teradata Vantage enviornment on [ClearScape Analytic Experience site](https://www.teradata.com/getting-started/demos/clearscape-analytics) to execute your functions against the dataset and prep your data.

5. **Submit your solution**:
   Once you've completed the notebook, submit the forked repo link to  to [Developer Relations](mailto:DR2300682@Teradata.com).

## Prize
By completing this challenge, you will be entered into a raffle to win a **Star Wars Lego Set $100 Value**!!! 
Make sure to submit your solution to qualify for the raffle.
