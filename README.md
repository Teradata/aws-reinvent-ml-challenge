# AWS re:invent 2024 ML Challenge

## Overview

Data preparation is a very important step in Machine Learning, but it can often be tedious and time-consuming. In fact, 80% of the time spent developing ML pipelines is typically dedicated to data preparation. Teradata simplifies this process with its powerful in-database analytic functions. In this challenge, you'll complete building a data preparation pipeline, but with a twist â€” we've removed the function names! By solving this challenge, you'll gain hands-on experience with Teradata's ClearScape Analytics and learn how it can make your data preparation tasks easier and more efficient. Complete the challenge (it should take less than 30 minutes) for an opportunity to enter a raffle and win a prize!!!
